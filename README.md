# TeardownSaveManager
A quick save/quick load manager for the steam game **Teardown**.

# Usage
1. Download the files and make sure all files are in the same folder.
3. Execute SaveManager.py and if everything runs smoothly you should see a prompt asking `Do you want to SAVE FILE (s) or LOAD FILE (l)?:` The program should find the right path in `path.txt` automatically but if not you can edit it to match your Teardown `quickgame.bin` file path.  
   _HINT: The `quicksave.bin` file may also be in `C:\Users\(Your Username)\Documents\Teardown\quicksave.bin`_
4. Follow the instructions provided by the program.
